# node-jre

This module will embed the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) into a Node.js app.
It will download the platform specific JRE at installation time.
Afterwards the embedding app can be bundled into a platform specific package.
This package would not require any further JRE installation steps by users.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save node-jre
```

## Usage

In this example we will run the a Java class-file at the relative path
`java/Hello.class`. It's source code `java/Hello.java` would look like this:

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, " + args[0] + "!");
    }
}
```

You can compile it with something like this:
```bash
javac java/Hello.java
```

By running the following file you should get `true` as output.

```javascript
var jre = require('node-jre');

var output = jre.spawnSync(  // call synchronously
    ['java'],                // add the relative directory 'java' to the class-path
    'Hello',                 // call main routine in class 'Hello'
    ['World'],               // pass 'World' as only parameter
    { encoding: 'utf8' }     // encode output as string
  ).stdout.trim();           // take output from stdout as trimmed String

console.log(output === 'Hello, World!'); // Should print 'true'
```

## API

`jre.install([callback])` Downloads and prepares a Java Runtime Engine (JRE). It is automatically called during module installation.
- `callback` (function(error)). Will be called when installation is finished. In case of any problems, `error` will be defined and contain a description.

`jre.spawn(classpath, classname[, args][, options])` Spawns a new child process by running the main method of a given Java class. This is a wrapper around [child_process.spawn]. Please look there for further documentation.
- `classpath` (array of strings). Paths to `.jar` files or directories containing `.class`files.
- `classname` (string). The Java class to run.
- `args` (array of strings).
  The command line arguments that are to be passed to the Java class's main method.
  Same as in [child_process.spawn].
- `options` (object). Options that are passed to [child_process.spawn].
- Returns an object of the type [child_process.ChildProcess].

[child_process.ChildProcess]: https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_class_childprocess


`jre.spawnSync(classpath, classname[, args][, options])` Synchronously spawns a new child process by running the main method of a given Java class. The command will not return until the spawned process ends. This is a wrapper around [child_process.spawnSync]. Please look there for further documentation.
- `classpath` (array of strings). Paths to `.jar` files or directories containing `.class`files.
- `classname` (string). The Java class to run.
- `args` (array of strings).
  The command line arguments that are to be passed to the Java class's main method.
  Same as in [child_process.spawnSync].
- `options` (object). Options that are passed to [child_process.spawnSync].
- Returns a result object as in [child_process.spawnSync].
